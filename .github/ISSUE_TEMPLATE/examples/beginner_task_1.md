## Overview

Currently, some error messages displayed when file operations fail are technical and not very user-friendly. This task involves improving these messages to be more descriptive and helpful for end users.

## Locations to Focus On

- File operations in `/utils/file_manager.py`
- Error handling in the batch operations tab
- Dialog messages in the Compare screen

## Expected Changes

- Rewrite error messages to be less technical and more action-oriented
- Add suggestions for how to resolve common issues
- Ensure consistency in message style across the application
- Update documentation to reflect the improved error handling

## Skills Needed

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of user experience principles
- No deep technical knowledge of the codebase required

## Difficulty

Easy - This is a great first contribution to get familiar with the codebase.

## Resources

- The existing error messages can be found by searching for `QMessageBox.critical` or `logging.error` calls
- Review our [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your PR
