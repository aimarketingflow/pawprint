# Pawprinting PyQt6 - V1 Functional Version

This marks Version 1 of the Pawprinting PyQt6 application as functionally complete as of 2025-06-03.

Key features implemented and working in V1 include:
- Fractal Butterfly generation from text input.
- Automatic default text usage if no text is provided by the user.
- Auto-truncation of text input beyond 2000 characters with appropriate user notifications.
- A suggestion banner encouraging users to input song lyrics for unique fractal patterns.
- Pawprint file loading for analysis.
- Display of raw JSON data from loaded pawprint files.
- Basic visualization capabilities for pawprint data.
- Saving and loading of fractal parameter configurations.
- Fixes to ensure analysis results populate correctly in the UI.

This version serves as a stable base before proceeding to V2 development, which will build upon these features.
