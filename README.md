## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- macOS (tested on macOS Monterey and later)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Pawprinting_PyQt6
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv_pawprinting_pyqt6
   source venv_pawprinting_pyqt6/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
source venv_pawprinting_pyqt6/bin/activate
python3 pawprint_pyqt6_main.py
```

For convenience, you can create an alias:

```bash
alias pawprint_pyqt6='cd /path/to/Pawprinting_PyQt6 && source venv_pawprinting_pyqt6/bin/activate && python3 pawprint_pyqt6_main.py'
```

### Generating a Pawprint

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Generate Pawprint" on the dashboard
3. Select a source folder or file containing the data to analyze
4. Configure generation options
5. Click "Generate Pawprint"

### Analyzing a Pawprint

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Analyze Files" on the dashboard
3. Select a pawprint file to analyze
4. Explore the analysis results
