## Implementation Tasks

### PyQt6 Implementation To Do
1. Create new `compare_screen.py` file in the screens directory
2. Implement `CompareScreen` class with the following components:
   - Main layout with file selection sidebar
   - Tab widget for different views (Comparison, Charts, Raw Data, Summary)
   - File explorer with tab filtering
   - Pattern explanations panel
   - Diff viewers (simple, JSON tree, side-by-side)
   - Chart generation using Matplotlib
3. Connect UI components to data models

### Data Model Integration
1. Implement pawprint comparison engine
2. Create data models for diff visualization
3. Implement file change tracking
4. Build pattern score comparison utilities

### Testing
1. Create test pawprints with known differences
2. Verify all UI components render correctly
3. Test navigation between different views
4. Validate diff visualization accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Begin PyQt6 implementation of the CompareScreen class
2. Create the necessary data models for storing comparison results
3. Implement visualization utilities for charts and diffs
4. Connect the Compare screen to the main application navigation

## Estimated Timeline
- UI Implementation: 2-3 days
- Data Model Integration: 1-2 days
- Testing and Refinement: 1 day
- Documentation Updates: 0.5 day
