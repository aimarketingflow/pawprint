  "text_input": "\n            The butterfly effect is the concept that small changes can have large effects.\n            Initially, it was used with weather prediction but later became a metaphor for \n            how small events can lead to significant changes in complex systems. The term comes\n            from the suggestion that the flapping of a butterfly's wings in Brazil might \n            eventually cause a tornado in Texas.\n            \n            In chaos theory, this behavior is seen in systems where a small change in initial\n            conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, making prediction impossible\n            beyond a certain time horizon. The butterfly effect is a poetic way to describe\n            this mathematical concept - that in a complex and interconnected world, small actions\n            can ripple outward to create massive transformations.\n            ",
