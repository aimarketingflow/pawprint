# Pawprinting PyQt6 V2 - Compare Screen Wireframes (2025-06-06)

## Project Overview
In this session, we focused on designing wireframes for a new dedicated "Compare" screen for the Pawprinting PyQt6 V2 application. Previously, the comparison functionality was part of the Analyze screen, but we identified that it would be better to have it as a separate main menu option.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Created wireframes for a new dedicated Compare screen**:
   - Main layout structure with sidebar and content area
   - File selection sidebar with grouping and filtering options
   - Comparison view showing differences between pawprints
   - Chart view for visual comparison of metrics
   - Raw data view to examine JSON structure
   - Summary view with key insights and statistics
   - Export dialog for generating reports in various formats
   - Filter options dialog for customizing comparison results

2. **Documentation organization**:
   - Created dedicated wireframes folder with indexed components
   - Developed a comprehensive implementation plan
   - Used consistent styling across all wireframe components
   - Maintained AIMF LLC branding throughout

3. **Git repository management**:
   - Completed pending merge operation
   - Added all new wireframe files and documentation
   - Committed with descriptive message
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub repository

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate Compare Screen**: Moving comparison functionality out of the Analyze screen into its own main navigation option to provide a focused comparison experience.

2. **Origin-Based Grouping**: Maintaining the concept of grouping pawprints by origin for meaningful comparisons.

3. **Tab-Based Interface**: Using tabs to organize different views within the comparison screen (comparison, charts, raw data, summary).

4. **Enhanced Visualizations**: Adding specialized chart types specifically for comparison purposes.

5. **Flexible Export Options**: Providing multiple export formats with customizable content.

## Implementation Path

The wireframes provide a blueprint for implementing the Compare screen as a new major feature in the Pawprinting V2 application. Implementation would involve:

1. Creating a new CompareScreen class
2. Developing the file selection components
3. Implementing comparison visualization logic
4. Adding tab navigation
5. Creating filtering and export functionality
6. Updating main navigation
7. Eventually removing redundant comparison features from the Analyze screen

## Repository Information
- GitHub Repository: git@github.com:aimarketingflow/pawprint.git
- Branch: main
- Current Commit: Added Compare screen wireframes and documentation

## Next Steps
- Implement the actual code for the Compare screen based on wireframes
- Consider expanding chart types specifically for comparison views
- Update main documentation index to include the Compare screen wireframes
