# Compare Screen Wireframes Development - June 6, 2025

## Summary of Work

Today we completed the modular wireframe components for the Compare Screen in the Pawprinting PyQt6 V2 application. The Compare Screen is designed to provide a dedicated interface for comparing pawprint files, showing differences, and providing insights about pattern divergences.

### Components Created:

1. **Main Layout & Navigation**
   - Created main layout structure with sidebar and content area
   - Designed file selection sidebar

2. **Comparison View Components**
   - Built modular comparison view components:
     - Main comparison view container
     - File explorer with filtering tabs
     - Pattern explanations panel
     - Multiple diff visualization options:
       - Simple line-by-line diff
       - JSON tree diff
       - Side-by-side diff
     - File detail view for individual file inspection

3. **Additional Views**
   - Charts view for visualizing pattern score changes
   - Raw data view for JSON inspection
   - Summary view for high-level reporting
   - Export dialog and filter options

### Organization and Structure:

All wireframe components are organized in the `/documentation/wireframes/compare_screen/` directory with clear naming conventions and navigation links between components. The modular approach allows easy updates to individual components without affecting others.

### Implementation Progress:

An implementation progress document was created to track completion status and outline next steps for the PyQt6 implementation phase.

## Technical Notes

- All wireframes use consistent dark mode styling with neon purple accents
- Cross-referencing between wireframes is implemented through navigation links
- File changes are visualized using color coding (green for additions, red for deletions)
- Pattern changes include severity indicators and detailed explanations
- Integration points with the existing Pawprinting PyQt6 V2 application are documented

## Next Steps

1. Begin PyQt6 implementation of the CompareScreen class
2. Create data models for storing and processing comparison data
3. Implement visualization utilities using Matplotlib
4. Integrate with the main application navigation flow
